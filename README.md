# Electricity Generation Visualization Project

This project provides interactive visualizations of electricity generation statistics in Mexico from 2018 to 2023. It also displays the most important power generation plants on a map using Leaflet, classified by the type of generation source and the production capacity of each plant. The visualizations are based on data from the Centro Nacional de Control de Energ√≠a (CENACE).

## Overview

The goal of this project is to offer insights into the trends and patterns of electricity generation in Mexico over a six-year period. By providing interactive visualizations, users can explore key statistics and gain a deeper understanding of the country's energy landscape.

## Key Features

* Interactive time series charts displaying electricity generation trends over time.
* Dynamic maps showcasing the locations and details of major power generation plants.
* Plant markers categorized by generation source type and production capacity.
* User-friendly interface for easy exploration and analysis of electricity generation data.

## Technologies Used

* Python: Data preprocessing and analysis.
* Pandas: Data manipulation and processing.
* Matplotlib and Plotly: Visualization libraries for creating interactive charts.
* Leaflet: Mapping library for displaying power plant locations.
* HTML and Bootstrap: Frontend development for the user interface.
* CENACE Data: Dataset containing electricity generation data for Mexico.
